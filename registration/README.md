Are Robots the Future of Elder Care?

Short summary of your thesis (maximum 100 words)

```
For the three minutes thesis presentation, I have planned to emphasise the increase of the
worldwide population, specially for the elder generation. Then, an alternative proposal to solve
such relevant issue with the use of robots and examples is going to be presented. 
By the end of the presentation,
I will highlight how I am contributing to science to make robots the future of elder care
