Hello,
 
I’m looking forward to seeing you on Thursday afternoon (3-5pm, Gisbert Kapp NG 15) for the 3MT training.  
You will get the most from this training if you have started to think about your 3MT presentation already, 
so you might like to watch some previous 3MT presentations online (see below), 
and start to think about how you will approach your own.  
If you get a chance to prepare a draft script (~350 words) 
and draft slide before Thursday’s training, please bring these with you.
 
Last year’s Birmingham 3MT final is available here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnAlHEC2soY
The national 3MT finalists’ presentations are here: 
https://www.vitae.ac.uk/events/three-minute-thesis-competition/3mt-finalists-2017/
 
See you Thursday!
 
Best wishes,
Georgina.

Hello all,
 
As promised, please find attached the slides from this afternoon’s workshop.  
I hope you found it useful, and I’m really looking forward to seeing your 3MTs.  
We have drop-in sessions next week (Thursday 26th April, 2-4pm, Gisbert Kapp N224) 
which is an opportunity for you to present your draft 3MT 
and get feedback from me and Eren, before the main heats the week after.
 
Good luck!
 
George.
