What is 3MT? 
Three Minute Thesis (3MT®) is a research communication competition developed 
by the University of Queensland, in which doctoral researchers 
have just three minutes to deliver an engaging presentation on their thesis topic, 
its originality and its significance. 
In the UK, the 3MT national competition final is hosted by Vitae and 
individual UK universities run their own competitions 
to put forward one winner per participating Institution.
