Dear All,
 

As you know, your final 3MT presentation will be filmed and 
made available on YouTube, so it’s important that any images/content 
you are using on your 3MT slide 
(which you didn’t create yourself) adhere to copyright law.  
Alex Fenlon, the University’s Head of Copyright and Licensing, 
has prepared the attached information to help you decide 
whether you are permitted to use the content you have chosen.  
For further information on copyright, see Library Services’ copyright webpages, 
and if you have any remaining questions, 
please contact copyright@contacts.bham.ac.uk for advice.  

 
Also, we will be promoting your research and the 3MT final on Twitter, 
so if you have a twitter account could you please email me your twitter name, 
so we can mention you in our tweets?


Best wishes,
Eren
