# EXTRAS
The University of Birmingham 3MT live final was held at the University of Birmingham 
on 16 May 2018 with 10 finalists competing in front of an audience and our judging panel. 
Our finalists presented their research and its significance in 3 minutes 
or less in a language that a non-specialist audience could understand. 
Based on the 3MT judging criteria, our judging panel determined this year’s winner. 

Congratulations go to Ella Hawkins from the College of Arts and Law who won this year’s competition 
and took home the prize of £500. Ella will also be representing us in the Vitae national 
3MT competition and in the U21 3MT competition.  Second place was awarded to Wilf Nelson 
from the College of Life and Environmental Sciences. 
Congratulations to Ella, Wilf and all our finalists who took part in the 3MT live final. 

Who will be the Public’s Choice winner? 
Our 3MT competition is not over yet. We still need to choose the Public’s Choice winner.
