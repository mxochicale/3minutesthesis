# Are Robots the Future of Elder Care?

If you are lucky enough, you will live to an average of 80 years.
But, have you ever wondered what it would be like turning 70, 80 or maybe 90 years old?
Now, imagine as we age, we will be gradually losing all of our
charming human senses including sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch.
In short, both our cognitive and motor skills will diminish as we age.

Now think about the people who will be with you until the last day of your life.
Will they be with you at all 
and most importantly will they take care of you 24/7?

Societies are aging world-wide.
According to the 2017 revision of the world population prospects[1], 
people age 60 years or over
are expected to be more than double by 2050 and to be more than triple by 2100[2].

Well, you don`t have to worry too much in the coming years, 
because this is where caregiver robots and MY RESEARCH come in.

In my PhD, 
I have created a novel analysis and interpretation of nonlinear time series
for movement variability.
Particularly,
I have studied, understood and implemented algorithms of nonlinear dynamics
in order to measure human movement variability.
I have also conducted experiments in the context of human robot-interaction 
where people follow upper arm movements performed by a robot 
in order to test the algorithms to measure movement variability[5].

Applications of my research are many but let me give you two examples
* (First) In the last five years, 
robots like Palro, a small humanoid robot, can play games and dance with the elder
and therefore keep their minds active, and
* (Second) Pepper, a personal humanoid robot,  has the partial power 
to read and respond to human emotions[0].
Both of the previous examples offer no feedback of people's movement when 
interacting with robots.

So, in the near future, caregiver robots will meet our physical and emotional needs as we age,
by encouraging social activities, healthy eating and exercise[4].
That is the future that I am working on.
A future where humanoid robots can automatically enhance and monitor physical activities of the elderly.

Perhaps my parents, back in Mexico, are not going to directly benefit 
from these technological advances 
but I do believe that 
future generations of people world-wide
will be assisted by caregiver robots,
therefore making the elderly more independent, happier and healthier!
