# ABSTRACT
If you are lucky enough, you will live to an average of 80 years.
But, have you ever wondered what it would be like turning 70, 80 or maybe 90 years old?
Now, imagine as we age, we will be gradually losing all our
charming human senses such as sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch.
In short, both our cognitive and motor skills will diminish as we age.

Now think about the people who will be with you until the last day of your life.
Will they be with you at all 
and most importantly will they take care of you?

And how about the global view of people who are ageing.
According to the 2017 revision of the world population prospects[1], 
people aged 60 years or over
are expected to be more than double by 2050 and to be more than triple by 2100[2].

Well, you don`t have to worry too much in the coming years, 
because this is where caregiver robots come in.
For example, in my PhD 
I have studied, understood and implemented algorithms of nonlinear dynamics
to measure human movement variability and I am working towards the use
of artificial neural networks 
for automatic recognition of human movement variability[5].

Application of my research are many, in the last decade, for example, 
experimental robots, mainly Japanese ones, have the capacity to help lift 
people into and out of their beds and chairs, follow recipes for cooking, 
fold towels or even dispense pills[3].
Recently, in the last five years robots like
Paro, a small humanoid robot, can play games and dance with the elder
and therefore keep their minds active.
Another example is Pepper and NAO, personal humanoid robots, that have the power 
to read and respond to human emotions[0]
and the list goes on and on.

In the near future, caregiver robots will meet our physical and emotional needs as we age,
by encouraging social activities, healthy eating and exercise[4].
That is the future that I am working on.
A future where humanoid robots can automatically enhance and monitor physical activities of the elderly.

Perhaps my parents, back in Mexico, are not going to be directly benefit 
from these technological advances 
but I do believe that future generations of people
will be assisted by caregiver robots,
therefore making the elderly more independent, happier and healthier!
