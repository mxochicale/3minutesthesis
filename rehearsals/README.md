Rehearsals
---

I will be updating this repository with regard to my rehearsals towards the three
minutes thesis competition. I think this is a good exercise to track my progress
in the use of English language.

**NOTE** From the recommendations, it is important to keep in mind that
"You should be aiming for approximately 200 -250 written words for your
three-minute summary".
