# ABSTRACT (200-250 words)
If you are lucky enough, you will live an average of 80 years.
But, have you ever wondered how would it be turning 60, 70, 80 or maybe 90 years old?
Now, think about as we are ageing, we will be gradually losing all our
charming human senses such as sigh, hearing, taste, smell, touch and  
even our motor skills will be minimised 
and our cognitive skills will be diminished.

Now think about the people who will be with you until the last day.
Will they be with you at all 
and most importantly will they take care of you?

Well, you don't have to worry too much in the coming years, 
because here is where assistive robots come up.
For instance, robots can assist us by helping to bring things for us, 
remind us to take our medicines,
or creating positive feelings to avoid loneliness
to mention but a few.

That is the future that I am working on.
A future where humanoids robots with the use of sensors and cameras
can understand human movement and therefore humanoid robots can enhance 
and monitor physical activities of the elderly.

Perhaps my parents, back in Mexico, are not going to be benefited 
from this technological advances 
but I do believe that future generations will be cared by Robots
and making the elderly more independent, happier and therefore healthier!
