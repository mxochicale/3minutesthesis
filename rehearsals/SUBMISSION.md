# ABSTRACT (200-250 words)

If you are lucky enough, you will live an average of 80 years.
But, have you ever wondered how would it be turning 60, 70, 80 or maybe 90 years old?
Now, think about as we are ageing, we will be gradually losing all our
charming human senses such as sigh, hearing, taste, smell, touch and  
even our motor skills will be minimised and our cognitive skills diminished.

Now think about the people who will be with you until the last day.
Will they be with you at all and most importantly will they take care of you?

Well, don't worry too much, here is where assistive robots come up.
For instance, by helping to bring us things, remembering to take our medicines,
or creating positive feelings to avoid loneliness.

That is the future that I am working on.
A future where humanoids robots with the use of sensors and cameras
can understand how humans move and therefore humanoid robots can enhance
and monitor physical activities

Perhaps my parents, back in Mexico, are not going to be benefited from this
technological advances but I do believe that future generation
will be cared by a Robots.
Making the elderly more independent, happier and healthier!
