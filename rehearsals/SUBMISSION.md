# TITLE
Robots Are the Future of Elder Care _21DEC2017_

# ABSTRACT

If you are lucky, you will live an average of 80 years. But, have you ever 
wondered how would be turning 60, 70, 80 or maybe 90 years old?
Now, think about as we are growing up we are losing all our charming 
human senses such as sigh, hearing, taste, smell, touch even our motor 
skills will be minimised. 
Now think about the people who will be with you until the last day. 
Will he/she/they be with you and mainly take care of you?

It is inevitable that we will get older but you are lucky, because such 
depressive reality is changing.
So here is when robots can help us, by helping to bring us things, 
remembering about our pill medicines. 
That is the future that I want. 
Perhaps my parents are not going to be benefited from this advances but 
I would like to think that maybe our future generation of elderly people
will be cared by a Robot.
