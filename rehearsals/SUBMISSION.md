# ABSTRACT (200-250 words)

If you are lucky, you will live an average of 80 years.
But, have you ever wondered how would it be turning 60, 70, 80 or maybe 90 years old?
Now, think about as we are ageing, we will be gradually losing all our charming human
senses such as sigh, hearing, taste, smell, touch even our motor
skills will be minimised and our cognitive skills.
Now think about the people who will be with you until the last day.
Will he/she/they be with you and most importantly will they take care of you?

Well, don't worry too much, here is where assistive robots come up.

So here is when robots can help us, by, for instance,
helping to bring us things,
remembering to take our medicines,
or creating positive feelings to avoid loneliness.

That is the future that I want and the future that I am working on.
Where humanoids robots by the use of sensors, cameras can understand
a bit more about how humans move and therefore a robot can enhance
and monitor physical activities and therefore
have a more balanced emotional state as we grow old.

Perhaps my parents, back in Mexico, are not going to be benefited from this
technological advances but I do believe that by
future generation of elderly people by 2050 will be cared by a Robots.
making them more independent, happier and healthier!
