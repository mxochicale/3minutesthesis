# TITLE
Robots will help the elderly _17Dec2017_


> You should be aiming for approximately 200 -250 written words for your three-minute summary

# ABSTRACT: 
Have you wondered how would be when you are turning 70, 80 and maybe 90
or even 100 if you are lucky? Think about that we are losing all our charming human senses:
sigh, hearing, taste, 
even our motor skills will be minimised. I know, that is very sad but inevitable. 
So here is when robots can help us, by helping to bring us things, remembering about 
our pill medicines.
That is the future that I want. Perhaps my parents are not going to be benefited 
from this advances but I would like to think that maybe myself will be saved
by a Robot.
