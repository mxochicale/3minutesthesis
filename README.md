Three Minute Thesis (3MT) [:link:](https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/as/studentservices/graduateschool/eventinfo/3MT.aspx)
---

Three Minute Thesis (3MT®) is a research communication competition developed 
by the University of Queensland in 2008, in which doctoral researchers have 
just three minutes to deliver an engaging presentation on their thesis topic,
its originality and its significance.

With universities across the world now holding their own 3MT competitions, 
we are delighted to be running a University of Birmingham 3MT and to invite 
our own doctoral researchers to participate in such a highly-regarded 
competition.

If you are a current doctoral researcher interested in developing your 
presentation and research communication skills, raising the profile of your 
research and having the chance to win an international research bursary, 
we warmly encourage you to take part. [Source](https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/as/studentservices/graduateschool/eventinfo/3MT.aspx).

## About Birmingham 3MT

If you enter the competition, you will be invited to take part in a 'heat' 
with other entrants from across the University and the top ten presenters 
from across these 'heat' events will be selected to compete in the final.

The competition will give you the opportunity to compete for a place in 
the nationwide UK 3MT contest. The winner of the Birmingham competition 
will go forward to the UK-wide 3MT semi-final, and to compete for 
one of six places in the UK final at the Vitae Annual Conference.

# Some top tips

* Be enthusiastic and show your passion for your subject
* Help the audience relate to your research by emphasising its relevance and any real-world applications or examples
* Speak clearly and don’t rush... if you tend to speed up when nervous, check yourself on this
* Time yourself and practice keeping within the three minute limit
* A comfortable speed of delivery for oral presentation is approximately 
80 words per minute. You should therefore be aiming for approximately 
200 -250 written words for your three-minute summary
* To structure your presentation, think about why you are researching your 
chosen topic or issue, how you are going about your research and 
how your work can be applied to the real world.
* Watch yourself in the mirror or record yourself using a camera phone so 
you can check your presentational style.
* Address your audience directly: don’t look down!
* Try to be natural and appear relaxed... Don’t move around too much 
(actions such as swaying can be distracting) but don’t appear static or 
rigid.
* Practice in front of friends who do not study in your area to ensure 
that your presentation is appropriate for a non-expert audience; 
if there are things they don’t understand, think about how you could 
express them more simply or clearly.
* Learn from previous winners by typing ‘three minute thesis winners’ 
into YouTube and watching the filmed presentations of past entrants

# Presentations will be judged according to the following criteria:

## Comprehension & Content
* Did the presentation provide an understanding of the background to the 
research question being addressed and its significance?
* Did the presentation clearly describe the key results of the research 
including conclusions and outcomes?
* Did the presentation follow a clear and logical sequence?
* Was the thesis topic, key results and research significance and 
outcomes communicated in language appropriate to a non-specialist audience?
* Did the speaker avoid scientific jargon, explain terminology and provide 
adequate background information to illustrate points?
* Did the presenter spend adequate time on each element of their 
presentation - or did they elaborate for too long on one aspect or was 
the presentation rushed?

## Engagement & Communication
* Did the oration make the audience want to know more?
* Was the presenter careful not to trivialise or generalise their research?
* Did the presenter convey enthusiasm for their research?
* Did the presenter capture and maintain their audience's attention?
* Did the speaker have sufficient stage presence, eye contact and vocal 
range; maintain a steady pace, and have a confident stance?
* Did the PowerPoint slide enhance the presentation - was it clear, 
legible, and concise?
